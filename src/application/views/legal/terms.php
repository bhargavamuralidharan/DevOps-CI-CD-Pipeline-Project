                <p> </p>
                <p><strong></strong><strong>CUSTOMS CLEARANCE</strong></p>
                <p>1.All shipments which cross international borders must be cleared through customs in the destination country
                    prior to delivery to the recipient. Clearance requires the presentation of the shipment and accompanying
                    paperwork to customs inspectors in the destination country. The duties of these customs officials may include
                    verifying the value and description of the contents (which may include opening the package) and properly
                    completing the required documentation.</p>
                <p>2. Wherever local law allows, we will submit your shipments to customs and other appropriate regulatory
                    agencies for clearance, and may advance duties and taxes on behalf of the payor provided appropriate credit
                    arrangements have been made in advance (See “Duties and Taxes”). Wherever permissible by local law,
                    Priority™ Worldwide services include customs clearance of your shipments. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER
                    PROVISION IN THESE Priority™ Worldwide TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTIVITIES
                    UNDERTAKEN BY US IN RELATION TO COMMODITIES BEING EXPORTED FROM CANADA, WE WILL NOT BE
                    LIABLE FOR ANY CANADIAN ADMINISTRATIVE MONETARY PENALTY SYSTEM PENALTIES (“AMPS PENALTIES”)
                    LEVIED AGAINST US AND/OR YOU, EVEN ARISING FROM OUR NEGLIGENCE, AND YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY
                    US AGAINST ANY SUCH AMPS PENALTIES. If local law requires that the shipments be cleared through customs
                    by the recipient, customs paperwork will be delivered to the recipient. In these cases, delivery of paperwork
                    constitutes shipment delivery.</p>
                <p>3.When shipments are held by customs authorities or other agencies for incorrect or missing documentation, we
                    may attempt first to notify the recipient. If local customs law requires the information to be submitted by the
                    recipient and the recipient fails or is unable to do so within a reasonable time, as we may determine, the
                    shipment will be considered “undeliverable” (See “Undeliverable Packages”). If the recipient fails or is unable
                    to supply the information and if local customs law allows the sender to submit that information, we may
                    attempt to notify the sender. If the sender also fails to supply the information requested within a reasonable
                    time, as we may determine, the shipment will be considered “undeliverable” (See “Undeliverable Packages”).
                    We assume no responsibility for our inability to complete a delivery due to incorrect or missing documentation,
                    whether or not we attempt to notify the recipient or sender. We assume no responsibility for our inability to
                    notify the recipient or sender.</p>
                <p>4.You are responsible for, and warrant your compliance with, all applicable international treaties, laws,
                    government regulations, orders or requirements including, but not limited to, customs and import laws and
                    regulations of any country to, from, through or over which your shipment may be carried. You agree to furnish
                    such information and complete such documents as are necessary to comply with such treaties, laws,
                    regulations, orders or requirements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“Declared value for carriage” is required by us to help determine transport liability limits, while “declared value
                        for customs” is required by customs officials for possible assessment of duties and taxes. The declared value
                        for carriage of any shipment (subject to the maximum amounts specified below) represents our maximum
                        liability in connection with a shipment, including, but not limited to, any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, nondelivery,
                        misinformation, any failure to provide information, or misdelivery of information relating to the
                        shipment. It is the shipper’s responsibility to prove actual damages. Exposure to, and risk of, any loss in excess
                        of the declared value for carriage (or in excess of the maximum amounts specified below) is assumed by the
                        shipper. You may transfer this risk to an insurance carrier of your choice through the purchase of an insurance
                        policy. Contact an insurance agent or broker if you desire insurance coverage. WE DO NOT PROVIDE
                        INSURANCE COVERAGE OF ANY KIND.</li>
                    <li>If you declare a higher value for carriage, an additional charge will be assessed for each $100 (or fraction
                        thereof) by which the declared value for carriage exceeds $100, the Warsaw Convention liability limit or the
                        Montreal Convention liability limit, whichever is applicable, up to the maximum amounts specified below.
                        Subject to the application of the Warsaw Convention and Montreal Convention, whether you declare a higher
                        value for carriage and pay the additional charge or not, our maximum liability for loss, damage, delay, misdelivery,
                        non-delivery, misinformation, any failure to provide information, or mis-delivery of information
                        relating to the shipment will be the lesser of the shipment’s repair costs, its depreciated value or its
                        replacement costs or your declared value for carriage (up to the maximum amounts specified in paragraph (g)
                        below).</li>
                    <li>We reserve the right to assess fuel and other surcharges on shipments without notice. The duration and amount of any surcharge will be determined
                        at our sole discretion. By tendering your shipment to us, you agree to pay all applicable surcharges, as determined by us.</li>
