        <p><strong><span>What are Cookies?</span></strong></p>
        <p><span>A cookie policy is a declaration to your users on what cookies are active on your website, what user data they track, for what purpose, and where in the world this data is sent.Also, a cookie policy should contain information on how your users may opt out of the cookies or change their settings in regard to the cookies on your website.While these laws are based in the EU, they apply to all businesses that market to EU consumers. This means that even US businesses who have EU customers need a dedicated cookie policy, that also meets the transparency and consent requirements of the Cookie Law.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Why is a cookie policy required?</span></strong></p>
        <p></span>Cookie disclaimers are required in both the US and the EU. However, there are no laws in the US that explicitly mandate a cookie policy needs to be held separately from a privacy policy.</span></p>
